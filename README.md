🔍 Project Overview
Over four intensive weeks, we worked hands-on with real-world learner data to develop a complete AI-powered data solution aimed at predicting student churn and enhancing engagement for digital learning platforms.

📊 Our analysis covered 8,500+ anonymized student records, applying data science methods to extract insights, build predictive models, and recommend actionable interventions.

🔐 Note: The datasets and detailed reports used in this project are confidential and may only be shared under specific conditions. Please reach out if you require access for academic or professional purposes, and it will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

## 🚀 Weekly Breakdown

### ✅ Week 1: Data Cleaning, Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Removed inconsistencies, null values, and irrelevant fields
- Created derived features (e.g., activity ratio, time gaps, etc.)

### ✅ Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
- Identified key patterns in student engagement, quiz attempts, and attendance
- Built custom visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

### ✅ Week 3: Predictive Modeling & Churn Analysis
- Built classification models using:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC

### ✅ Week 4: Final Report, Presentation & Recommendation System
- Delivered presentation with visual insights and strategic suggestions
- Proposed a **data-driven recommendation system** to improve learner retention
