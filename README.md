## 🚀 Weekly Breakdown

### ✅ Week 1: Data Cleaning, Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Removed inconsistencies, null values, and irrelevant fields
- Created derived features (e.g., activity ratio, time gaps, etc.)

### ✅ Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
- Identified key patterns in student engagement, quiz attempts, and attendance
- Built custom visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

### ✅ Week 3: Predictive Modeling & Churn Analysis
- Built classification models using:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC

### ✅ Week 4: Final Report, Presentation & Recommendation System
- Delivered presentation with visual insights and strategic suggestions
- Proposed a **data-driven recommendation system** to improve learner retention
